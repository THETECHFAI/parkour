# Landing Ripple Effect Design (2025-03-22 11:21:19)

_**User**_

the players feet seem to get lost on the surface, sinking a little too much, can you make sure they land on ethsurface and dont sink into.

Let me find out where the player physics is handled to fix the sinking issue.

Let's search for physics-related code in main.js that might handle player-surface interactions:
