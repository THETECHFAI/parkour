Let me help you add different biomes or districts with unique visual styles to your Parkour2 project. First, I'll explore the project structure to understand how it's organized.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `index.html` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📁 `models` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📄 `package-lock.json` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |

</details>

---

Now I'll examine the source code to understand how the game is structured:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `main.js` |

</details>

---

Let me check the models directory to understand how 3D assets are organized:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory models • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Now I'll look at the index.html file to understand how the game is set up:

---

Read file: index.html

---

Now I'll examine the main.js file to understand how the game's visuals and environment are implemented:

---

Read file: src/main.js

---

Let me look more closely at how the environments are created:

---

Read file: src/main.js

---

Let me check how the game initializes to understand how to integrate new biomes properly:

---

Read file: src/main.js

---

Now I'll check how the obstacles are created to understand the current visual style:

---

Read file: src/main.js

---

Based on my review of the code, I understand the structure of the Parkour2 game and how the environments are created. The game uses a cyberpunk theme with a main rooftop and various obstacles and platforms. To add different biomes or districts with unique visual styles, I'll need to:

1. Create distinct biome areas on the map
2. Implement new visual styling for each biome
3. Ensure the new biomes blend well with the existing cyberpunk theme

Here's my implementation plan:

I'll continue implementing the biomes feature. Let me edit the main.js file to add different biomes with unique visual styles:
